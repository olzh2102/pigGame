Pig Game - rolling the dice between two players 

This game is written with vanilla JS to practice my skills in JS

GAME RULES:

- The game is between 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes and each result gets added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a number 1, he loses his ROUND score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
